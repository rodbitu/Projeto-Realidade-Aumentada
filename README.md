# Augmented Reality Project

## Project Description

This project is an interactive learning tool that uses augmented reality to teach about different types of cellular structures, such as CCC (Cubic Body-Centered), CFC (Cubic Face-Centered), HC (Hexagonal Close-Packed), and other crystalline models. Its goal is to enhance students' curiosity and allow for a deeper exploration of atomic structures in a fun and practical way.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were applied in this project to facilitate development and user interaction:

- **Unity**: Used to create interactive 3D environments and integrate three-dimensional models of cellular structures.
- **Vuforia**: Augmented reality SDK for Unity, used for image and object recognition and tracking in the real world.
- **Blender**: 3D modeling software for creating and animating cellular structures.
- **GitHub**: Versioning and code collaboration platform, used to manage project development.

## Team

- **Luciano Silva Alves Junior**
- **Matheus Lima Monteiro**
- **Rodrigo Bitu de Moraes**
